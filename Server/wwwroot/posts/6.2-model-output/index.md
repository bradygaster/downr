To access the prediction, define the schema of the output created by the model. In the *Shared* project, create a new class called `ModelOutput` with the `Score` property of type `float`. This property contains the output or predicted price generated by the model.

```csharp
public class ModelOutput
{
    public float Score { get; set; }
}
```
